This web-app allows you to interact with both Youtube and Spotify via their APIs, for being able to convert any playlist between these two big platforms.
The goal for this project was mainly practicing coding an app that has a backend and a frontend, both handled by me (React JS for the client-side code, Flask & Python for
the server-side one), and making music truly boundless for the people that, like me, love music.
Developed and designed entirely by Samuel Roufaeil.
